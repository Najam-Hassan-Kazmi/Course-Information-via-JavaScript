# Course-Information-via-JavaScript
This is a short JavaScript assignment project for practicing the use of components, props and objects. This covers, with proper comments, the process of creating components and passing arguments to other components. Let's see how these concepts in JavaScript are vital and helpful!

This repository covers the exercises from 1.1-1.5, part 1 of the course "Deep Dive into the Modern Web Development". We can simply upload the final result of all these exercises and that is what I will be doing here. Let us try and clarify our concepts regarding parameters, components and props.

I have added two files named App.jsx and main.jsx as per my assignment requirements. To access the code, you can check out the file "App.jsx". I have added enough comments to make it easy and readable. Please feel free to get in touch with me if you are having issues understanding any of the things in there.

Thank you!
